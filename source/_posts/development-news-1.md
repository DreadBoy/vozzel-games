In first edition of Development news we are going to take a look at progress so far, rant about Twitter's crappy video compression and make predictions about first public alpha.

## Twitter compresses video to oblivion and I don't like it

I like to frequently show off progress on Twitter in form of short videos because they are so easy to record but I noticed those videos look much worse on Twitter than on my computer. At first I thought it's because I viewed them on 4G but even when I switched to fast Wi-Fi quality didn't improve. And as far as I can tell, this won't change in the near future. I also tried Imgur and Gfycat but their Twitter integration is non-existent hence I'm not going to use them. So, until I figure out how to easily and quickly transcode video to gif I'm forced to spread those low quality videos. But fear not, I can still upload full resolution videos to my blog and display them in their full glory right here. üòÅ

## Recent changes and additions

Did I mention I love Git? Currently I'm using it to manage the project and by using `git log --since="2017-11-11"` I can display all commits I made since I started writing this blog, that date being 11. November 2017. It says I made 115 commits, changing (added or removed) 23483 lines of code in 360 files. üò≤ Luckily I can also display all commit messages since that date and in case you want to comb through my Git history, you are welcome to do so. Reading back, some commit messages really don't make sense...

To sum up changes in last month: saving and loading, main menu, first machines and tools, QOL improvements (tooltips, callouts). I also optimized world rendering but unless you are really observant, you won't notice any changes. Question at that point is probably *"When are you going to release something we can play?"*. And the good news is I expect to release first public alpha in a couple of weeks. Goal for first release is full implementation of first process that will take you from basic automatic tree farm all the way to windmill crafting. Hopefully this will give us first feeling of what the gameplay will look like. But to achieve that, I need to expand functionality of tools since they can currently be used only by player and also add a bunch of machines for different operations in mention process.
