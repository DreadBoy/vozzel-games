Almost a month ago I promised to finish a game... It's starting to take shape!

## First, a little setback

Right after I posted {% post_link just-finish-the-game previous post %} I came down for 2 weeks with nasty lung infection that didn't even allow me to lay down in bed, I had to sleep at kitchen table, leaning forward. Luckily modern medicine quickly helped me overcome that infection and after 3 weeks of recovery I'm finally at full strength and of clear mind, able to code again.

Looking back at feature list in previous post, I can tick off 2 features I managed to implement:

<ul class="checklist"><li class="checked">player moves ship and shoots bullets</li><li class="checked">game spawns new enemies all the time</li><li>enemies move and shoot, behaviour is determined by enemy</li><li>game tracks player's HP and score</li><li>game displays end screen when player is dead</li></ul>

<p>And let me tell you, it's nice to have clear plan and list of features I can tick off. ðŸ™‚ It's also nice to have something to show off:</p>
