Another month has gone by and another 2 features were ticked off, I implemented start and game over screen, together with HP and score counter. There's only 1 feature left before I could call it a day and release a game but while play testing I figured I need to add some sounds and possibly some explosions to make game more immersive. Scope changes are really dangerous due to possible scope bloat but I think sounds and basic animations are important for game experience so I'll make that one exception and expand scope for two more items.

<ul class="checklist"><li class="checked">player moves ship and shoots bullets</li><li class="checked">game spawns new enemies all the time</li><li>enemies move and shoot, behaviour is determined by enemy</li><li class="checked">game tracks player's HP and score</li><li class="checked">game displays end screen when player is dead</li><li>animated explosions for enemies and player</li><li>background music and sound effects (explosions, bullets)</li></ul>
